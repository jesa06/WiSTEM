    "### 3.14\n",
    "Essential Knowlege:\n",
    "- Software libraries contain procedures used in creating novel programs.\n",
    "- Existing code segments can be derived from internal or external sources: Libraries, Previously written code.\n",
    "- Libraries simplify complex programs.\n",
    "- APIs (application program interfaces) specify how procedures in libraries should behave and be utilized.\n",
    "- Documentation for APIs/Libraries are necessary to gain proper understanding into how to use them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vocab:\n",
    "- Documentation: Text that explains the what, how, or why of your code.\n",
    "- Libraries: A collection of prewritten code or procedures that coders can use to maximize their efficiency\n",
    "- Application Programming Interface: A type of software through several computers are able to communicate information amongst eachother\n",
    "\n",
    "Reusing code:\n",
    "- The block will move backwards ,move forwards, rotate right, then move forward twice.\n",
    "- We should know how to follow this procedure to get the robot from one spot to another\n",
    "- Use our words to explain procedure\n",
    "    - Keeps adding the number to the variable sum.\n",
    "    - This procedure takes a list represetning percentages then represents the integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Practice Problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Which of the following would be MOST useful as part of a program that determines Grade Point Average?\n",
    "- Answer: 2 because you calculate an average by adding a sum of two numbers. \n",
    "- \"n order to calculate a GPA, it is necessary to take sum of the letter grades' corresponding numbers, and divide them by the number of grades\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Which of the following would be LEAST useful in a program that helps choose the best restaurant within 5 miles of your location?\n",
    "- Answer: 3 this wouldn't help us pick a resturaunt it would help pick a vegetarian option not the best food place.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.15\n",
    "\n",
    "Randomization:\n",
    "- Write expressions to generate possible values\n",
    "- Evaluate expressions to determine the possible results\n",
    "\n",
    "Need to know:\n",
    "- each result is as likely to occur as the others.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Example Problem:\n",
    "- answer1 = random(0,2)\n",
    "- answer2 = random(1,5)\n",
    "- answer3 = answer1 + answer2\n",
    "\n",
    "- Answer: 1-7 because the lowest possible value is 1 and the greatest is 7.\n",
    "- [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Example Problem: \n",
    "- A) sum = 3 * random(1,6)\n",
    "- B) sum = random(1,18)\n",
    "- C) sum = random(1,6) + random(1,6) + random(1,6)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Answer: C because theres three trials\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Answer: C 3 1 2 it has to be three and you can eliminate the other choices.\n",

    "- I really liked the practice problems for the different lesson types because they were very manageable and related to what I was taught. I also learned the vocab about documentation and libraries. I also especially liked the section on randomization because I found it the most interesting and fun. I also learned that APIs can be used to make storing and using data easier.\n",

    "- C. A random word from variable a to variable b exclusive.\n",
    "- D. A random word from variable a to variable b inclusive.\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER+EXPLANATION:\n",
    "- B is the correct answer because the data type is an integer not a string so it would not be a word it would be an integer. Also it would be inclusive over exclusive because a and b would be part of the situation and can each be the integer picked at random.\n",

    "- D. x = step, y = start, z = stop\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER+EXPLANATION:\n",
    "- A is the correct answer because in the lesson, a general radgrange is written like this: random.radrage(start, stop, step). Now, if you compare the leters and words relative to each other, you would get the answer A. Where x is start, y is stop, and z is stop. It also means that x is the minimus value and y is the maximum value based on the order. What z being the step means is that it is the increment the values can be.\n",

    "1. What is the advantage of using libraries?\n",
