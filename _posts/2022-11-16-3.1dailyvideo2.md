# What will **you** learn?

You will learn how to determine the value of a variable as a result of an assignment.

### Essential Knowledge

- The assignment operater allows a program to change the value represented  a variable. 
- The exam reference sheet uses the "⟵" to use for assignment. For example,
    Text: a ⟵ expression
    Then the code would display a block text of "a ⟵ expression". The code will evaluate expression and then assigns a copy of the result to the variable a. 
- The value stored in a variable will be the most recent value assigned. For example,
    a ⟵ 1
    b ⟵ a
    a ⟵ 2
    display(b)

    The code will display 1. 


### Storing Values

When storing values, you assign them to a variable. 

Examples: 

highScore ⟵ 100
The highScore is my assignment operator and it is storing the value of 100 inside itself as a variable. This will set my highScore to 100. 

firstName ⟵ "Ashley"
The firstName is the variable and the text we are storing inside is "Ashley." We know that the name is in text because of the quotation marks around the assignment.

isRaining ⟵ true
The isRaining variable has the intention to be a Boolean variable which checks true or false, but it's been assigned to store the value true.
