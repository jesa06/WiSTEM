# Essential Knowledge 
- Lists are conveninent and helpful because lists allow consistent computations and changing the number of variables 
- Data abstractions managae complexity through naming a collection of data without representing specifics 
- Data abstraction helps create a easier and conveninent program 
- Using lists helps multiple items that are related to each other to be treated a single value 

# Hacks

1. Which of the following scenarios illustrates the benefit of using a list as a date abstraction in program to manage complexity? Select 2 answers. 
 - A. Keep track of customers in a line to check online 
 - B. Prevent the same number to be entered for exam scores
 - C. Keep track of every single input value during program execution
 - D. Curve every value by 2 points for a set of exam scores 

 2. How can a line of code using a list manage the complexity of this code?
