# 3.1 and 3.2

This was our group so we presented and we were the ones grading.

# 3.3 and 3.4

### 0.95/1

Comments: " This person took all the notes and had answers with explanations"

Reflection: I think that I got a 0.95/1 because I gave a lot of effort. When they were explaining I took notes to make sure i understood the lesson when I did the hacks. I also went into more detail after I answered because I would struggle and needed it to explain it to myself. I wrote learning lessons after each problem and my overall thoughts and reflection. 

# 3.5 - 3.7

### 0.9/1

Comments: "Good notes, completed all problems"

Reflection: I think I got this score because although I did all the hacks, I wasn't super thourough on my notes. I did have everything and I completed all that I needed to. If I had more stuff added, I would have gotten a higher grade.

# 3.8 - 3.10

### 0.9/1

Comments: "Try adding the image tag to your notebook and committing. That's what our group found to work. Vocab extras present"

Reflection: I think I got this score because although I did everything, I didn't do any extras. The only extras I did were extra vocab in addition to the hacks. I thought my reflections were very thourough but I didn't add anything that was super special or made me stand out and super good compared to everyone else in the class. 

# 3.9 - 3.11

### 0.85/1

Comments: "Had everything except the equation diagram."

Reflection: I worked really hard on this blog and did a lot of extra stuff. However, I did forget one of the diagrams for the equations. I did 3 extra scenarios with practice from the lesson. The equation diagram was not included. I also did the necessary notes and vocab and the rest of the necessary requirements.

# 3.12 - 3.13

### 1/1

Comments: "Tooks notes on each individual section and explained each asnwer along with doing tons of extra work"

Reflection: I did this section very dilligently and took thourough notes. I also completed all the required and necessary hacks with accuracy and purpose. The reason I think I got a 1/1 is because I took extra notes on the topic of creating programs. My notes and hacks were up to standard.

# 3.14 - 3.15

### 0.9/1

Comments: "MC explanations very thourough, All other meets requirements"

Reflection: I met all the requirements for the MC. I got all the problems correct while giving explanations on why I chose these choices. It was very beneficial for my learning. I also answered the short answer questions and did the coding challenges. I didn't do or attempt the extra credit challenges so I only got a 0.9.
