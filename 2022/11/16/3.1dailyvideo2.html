<h1 id="what-will-you-learn">What will <strong>you</strong> learn?</h1>

<p>You will learn how to determine the value of a variable as a result of an assignment.</p>

<h3 id="essential-knowledge">Essential Knowledge</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The assignment operater allows a program to change the value represented  a variable.</li>
  <li>The exam reference sheet uses the “⟵” to use for assignment. For example,
  Text: a ⟵ expression
  Then the code would display a block text of “a ⟵ expression”. The code will evaluate expression and then assigns a copy of the result to the variable a.</li>
  <li>
    <p>The value stored in a variable will be the most recent value assigned. For example,
  a ⟵ 1
  b ⟵ a
  a ⟵ 2
  display(b)</p>

    <p>The code will display 1.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="storing-values">Storing Values</h3>

<p>When storing values, you assign them to a variable.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<p>highScore ⟵ 100
The highScore is my assignment operator and it is storing the value of 100 inside itself as a variable. This will set my highScore to 100.</p>

<p>firstName ⟵ “Ashley”
The firstName is the variable and the text we are storing inside is “Ashley.” We know that the name is in text because of the quotation marks around the assignment.</p>

<p>isRaining ⟵ true
The isRaining variable has the intention to be a Boolean variable which checks true or false, but it’s been assigned to store the value true.</p>
